Since _AcceleratXR_ is a suite of many libraries and services the documentation is organized per system. Also note that not all systems may have all types of documentation available.

Each system features several types of documentation available:

- API reference documentation
- REST API reference documentation
- Concepts
- Tutorials

### API Reference Documentation

The API reference documentation provides detailed information about the classes, interfaces, data models and functions for a particular library or service.

### REST API Reference Documentation

The REST API reference documentation describes how to interact with a particular service over HTTP. Documentation is typically broken up into two main sections; _models_ and _routes_. The _models_ documentation details the individual data models managed by the service that may be sent or received from any given REST API route. The _routes_ documentation details the specific request and response interaction for any given HTTP endpoint.

### Concepts

The concepts section provides long-form, in-depth articles about each system such as technical explanations and white papers.

### Tutorials

The tutorials section provides guided explanation of how to perform specific tasks and implement specific features using a given system.
