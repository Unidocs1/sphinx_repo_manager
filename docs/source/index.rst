Our Philosophy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Faster time to market
* Reduced development cost
* Lower cost of ownership

Time to Market
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike other platforms that offer limited features focused on simple mobile games, Xsolla Backend is built by
fellow game developer veterans who understand the challenges of timely product delivery.

Our priority is to equip you with a **complete** suite of built-in systems and features, allowing your team to
concentrate on creating games without the worries of backend infrastructure.

Development Cost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Budget constraints are a major challenge. Many platforms overpromise but underdeliver, leading to hidden costs and
additional development work. With Xsolla Backend, you get a platform engineered to meet the highest AAA standards.
Our source-available approach ensures you have full control and flexibility to customize as needed.

Save time, reduce costs and eliminate surprises with Xsolla Backend â€” the reliable, high-quality, and cost-effective
solution for your game development needs.

Total Cost of Ownership
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The true measure of a game's success lies in its ability to remain profitable long after launch. Many games have failed
due to exorbitant hosting and operational costs that outpace revenue. At Xsolla Backend, we understand this challenge
intimately. Our platform is meticulously designed to be cost-effective, ensuring your game remains profitable.

By focusing on cost-efficiency, flexible licensing, and a robust feature set, Xsolla Backend offers the lowest total
cost of ownership in the market. Our unique, open philosophy gives you unparalleled tools, features, and flexibility,
empowering you to innovate and achieve your biggest ambitions.
