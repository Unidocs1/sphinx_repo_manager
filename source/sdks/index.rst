There are a number of Software Development Kits available enabling integration with the AcceleratXR platform. They are
separated into two different types: general purpose and game engine SDKs.

General Purpose SDKs
====================

A general purpose SDK is provided in a variety of popular languages making it easy to integrate the AcceleratXR
platform into your application or service.

Supported Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `C++ <cpp>`_
* `C# <csharp>`_
* `JavaScript/TypeScript <nodejs>`_

Game Engine SDKs
================

In addition to the general purpose SDKs noted above are plug-ins and tools made available for popular game
engines such as Unity and Unreal. These SDKs tend to utilize a particular general purpose SDK and build upon it to
provide additional functionality to make the integration process simpler for developers of those engines.

Supported Engines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Unity Engine <unity>`_
* `Unreal Engine <unreal>`_
