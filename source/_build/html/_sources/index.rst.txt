Composer is a simple, light-weight and opinionated framework for rapidly developing scalable REST API services for NodeJS, written in TypeScript.

The framework combines the OpenAPI specification with a simple functional programming model to provide a highly expressive and powerful system for developing REST API services.

Features
========

* Built on OpenAPI
* HTTP 1.x/2.x Web Server
* WebSocket Support
* Global Configuration
* Dependency Injection
* Built-in behaviors for common REST API actions
* Built-in ORM layer
* Document Version Tracking
* MongoDB support
* Redis support
* 2nd Level Caching
* Authentication
* Role Based Access Control
* Prometheseus metrics

Getting Started
===============

Using Composer is as simple as 1-2-3.

Step 1
******

Define the REST API service using `OpenAPI <openapi.html>`_ and save it as ``service.yaml``.

`Click here for an example <https://gitlab.com/AcceleratXR/composerjs/cli/-/raw/master/test/petstore.yaml>`_.

Step 2
******

Generate the project using the Composer CLI.

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   yarn global add @composer-js/cli
   composer -i ./service.yaml -o . -t server -l nodejs

Step 3
******

Start the server!

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   yarn install
   yarn start
