Installing AcceleratXR
======================

This article details the steps to install the AcceleratXR platform to Kubernetes. Before you begin make sure that all
`pre-requisites <prerequisites>` have been installed and configured correctly.

Clone the Helm Chart
====================

A Helm chart capable of deploying the platform including all supported micro-services, databases and stats servers is
available at https://gitlab.com/AcceleratXR/Core/tools/k8s_deploy. First clone this repository locally. If you are a
subcriber at the `Professional <https://gitlab.com/AcceleratXR/professional/tools/k8s_deploy>`,
`Studio <https://gitlab.com/AcceleratXR/studio/tools/k8s_deploy>` or
`Enterprise <https://gitlab.com/AcceleratXR/enterprise/tools/k8s_deploy>`
tier there is a matching helm chart for each respective tier.

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   git clone git@gitlab.acceleratxr.com:Core/tools/k8s_deploy.git

Chart Dependencies
==================

Before the helm chart can be used the dependencies must be locally downloaded and initialized. This is done with the
following command.

.. code-block:: bash
   :linenos:

   helm dep up
