## **A. The Licensed Technology**

### **1. What Technology Xsolla Is Licensing to You**

The Licensed Technology licensed to you under this Agreement includes all Xsolla Backend code and related content that is copied to your computer when you install Xsolla Backend.

This includes Backend Code, Examples, and Starter Content, in particular

-   “Backend Code” means the Source Code (as defined below) and object code of Xsolla Backend, including any future versions made available to you by us under this Agreement and any object code compiled from that Source Code.
-   “Source Code” means the human readable form of a software program, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation, and installation of an executable.
-   “Examples” means the code, artwork, or other content made available by us in the Samples and Templates folders in the install directory.
-   “Starter Content” means the code, artwork, or other content made available by us and installed to your computer when you install Xsolla Backend, excluding Examples.

The Licensed Technology includes any modified version of any of the foregoing that you make under the License.

Licensed Technology does not include any items, assets, content, or other materials that we may make available to you in other ways (the “Content”), even if that Content can be used with Xsolla Backend. For example, assets you may download from Xsolla Backend Marketplace are not Licensed Technology and are not licensed to you under the terms of this Agreement.

### **2. How You Can Use the Licensed Technology**

Xsolla grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to privately use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify the Licensed Technology in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the “License”). This means that as long as you are not violating this Agreement or applicable law, you can privately use the Licensed Technology however you want. If you want to share the Licensed Technology or anything you make with it, Sections 3 and 4 below address when and how you can do that.

### **3. How You Can Share Products You’ve Made with the Licensed Technology**

If you develop products, services, or any other projects that (i) are made using any Licensed Technology or (ii) combine any Licensed Technology with any other software or content (collectively “Products”), you may only Distribute those Products as expressly permitted in this Section 3. Any Product that you Distribute that incorporates Licensed Technology must incorporate the Licensed Technology only in object code and only as an inseparable part of the Product.

“Distribute” means, with respect to a Product, to provide or otherwise make a copy of the Product available publicly or to any other person or entity or make the Product’s functionality available on a network.

a. Indirect Revenue

You will not owe us any royalty payments for Distributing Products to any person or entity if the Products do not directly generate revenue -- i.e., no revenue is attributable to any Product access, including features and functionality within the Product, or to any in Product benefits.

This means, for example, that Distribution of a free car configurator app (a Product) used to sell cars will not result in royalties owed on sales of the cars themselves, even if the sales are made via the configurator app.

b. Other Royalty-Free Distributions

You will not owe us any royalty payments for Distributing Products:

A. To the legal entities that are part of your company group, such as a parent company or a subsidiary, for their private use, so long as those entities do not further Distribute the Products outside of your company group. \*

This means, for example, applications (which would be Products) you create for internal use within your company can also be shared with your parent company, your subsidiary, or another subsidiary of your parent company.

B. To clients who hired you to develop the Products for them, for their private use, so long as your clients do not further Distribute the Products. \*

This means, for example, if you are hired to create an application (a Product), you can share that application with your client.

C. To other third parties who are separately licensed by us to use the Backend Code, through either the Xsolla Backend Marketplace or through a fork of Xsolla’s GitLab server.

This means, for example, you may Distribute a plugin, library, web service, or tool to end users through the Xsolla Backend Marketplace or through Xsolla’s Xsolla Backend GitLab repository.

*\* If your Product includes Backend Tools, it may only be Distributed pursuant to C above.*

“Backend Tools” means the (i) libraries, services, scripts and other tools included in the Backend Code; (ii) any code and modules in either the Deploy, Scripts or Tools folders, including in object code format, whether statically or dynamically linked; and (iii) other software that may be used to develop standalone products based on the Licensed Technology.

c. Royalty Bearing Distribution

You may make other Distributions of Products, but unless described in Section 3(a), all Distributions of a Product will be subject to the terms of the attached Royalty Addendum. Additionally, any advance royalty payment you receive to develop such a Product will be subject to the Royalty Addendum.

This means, for example, that you may owe royalties to Xsolla for Products that are sold to the general public or for off-the-shelf Products that you sell privately to third parties, whether directly by you or through a distributor or publisher.

d. Use by End Users, Publishers, and Distributors

When you Distribute a Product, you may permit end users to use, reproduce, display and publicly perform the Licensed Technology, solely 1 as incorporated in the Product in object code as an inseparable part of the Product, 2 to the extent necessary for end users to make permitted uses of the Product, and 3 pursuant to an end user license agreement that explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Licensed Technology. You may not permit your end users to incorporate any Licensed Technology into their own products, services, or other projects.

You may, however, permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute a Product on your behalf, but only to the extent that you are permitted to make such Distribution yourself under this Section 3, and such Distribution will be subject to the terms of this Agreement.

### **4. How You Can Share the Licensed Technology When It Isn’t Part of a Product**

You may only Distribute Licensed Technology (including as modified by you) outside of a Product as expressly permitted by this Section 4.

a. Sharing of Backend Code

*i. Sharing Backend Code with Another Licensee*

You may Distribute Backend Code (including as modified by you) in Source Code or object code to a third party who is separately licensed by us to use the same version of the Backend Code that you are Distributing.

Any public Distribution of Backend Tools (e.g., intended generally for third parties who are separately licensed by us to use the Backend Code) must take place through a marketplace operated by Xsolla such as the Xsolla Backend Marketplace (e.g., for Distributing a Product’s modding tool or editor to end users) or through a fork of Xsolla’s GitLab server (e.g., for Distributing Source Code).

*ii. Sharing Backend Code for Public Discussion*

You are permitted to post snippets of Backend Code, up to 30 lines of code in length, online in public forums for the sole purpose of discussing the content of the snippet or Distribute such snippets in connection with supporting patches and plug-ins for the Licensed

Technology, so long as it is not for the purpose of enabling third parties without a license to the Backend Code to use or modify any Backend Code or to aggregate, recombine, or reconstruct any larger portion of the Backend Code.

b. Sharing Examples

You may Distribute Examples (including as modified by you) in Source Code or object code to any third party.

### **5. Other Restrictions on Your Use of the Licensed Technology**

a. Non-Compatible Licenses

You may not, and may not permit others to, combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Licensed Technology with any code or other content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the Licensed Technology be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement (those licenses, the “Non-Compatible Licenses”). This means, for example, that you may not combine the Licensed Technology with code or content that is licensed under any of the following licenses: GNU General Public License GPL , Lesser GPL LGPL (unless you are merely dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.

b. General Restrictions

You must ensure that your activities with the Licensed Technology do not:

● violate any applicable law or regulation;

● result in the Licensed Technology being rented or leased;

● misappropriate any of our other products or services;

● support a claim by you or any third party that the Licensed Technology infringes a patent;

● result in a sale or grant of a security interest in any Licensed Technology; or

● result in a Distribution of a Product or the Licensed Technology in any manner other than is permitted by Sections 3 and 4.

### **6. Who Owns What**

As between you and us, you own all rights, other than rights in the Licensed Technology, in the Products you develop under this Agreement, and we own all title, ownership rights, and intellectual property rights in the Licensed Technology.

All rights granted to you under this Agreement are granted by the License only and not by sale, and all of those rights are limited by and subject to the terms of this Agreement. No license or other right in any Xsolla technology or intellectual property rights other than the Licensed Technology is granted under this Agreement, and no license or other rights will be created under this Agreement by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. Any attempted sublicense that is not consistent with the terms of this Agreement will be null and void.

a. Proprietary Notices and Attribution

You agree to retain the copyright, trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Xsolla as they appear in the Licensed Technology.

If a Product you develop under this Agreement has credits, you must place the following notices in the credits (replacing xxxx with the current year):

-   “[Product name] uses Xsolla Backend. Xsolla Backend is a trademark or registered trademark of Xsolla USA, Inc. in the United States of America and elsewhere.”
-   “Xsolla Backend, Copyright 2018 - xxxx, Xsolla USA, Inc. All rights reserved.”

No other license or right is granted under this Agreement in the trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos associated with Xsolla, Xsolla’s products, services and other intellectual property, including Xsolla Backend (the “Xsolla Trademarks”). All use of the Xsolla Trademarks will inure to the sole benefit of Xsolla. You agree not to engage in any activity that could tarnish, dilute, or affect the validity or enforceability of the Xsolla Trademarks or cause consumer confusion or diminish any goodwill relating to any Xsolla Trademarks.

If you wish to make further use of the Xsolla Trademarks, please go to [design.xsolla.com](https://design.xsolla.com) for more information.

b. Third Party Software

The Licensed Technology incorporates and is bundled with code developed by third parties (the “Third Party Software”) that may be subject to additional or alternative license terms. If Third Party Software is incorporated in the Licensed Technology and is subject to additional license terms, those terms or other attribution requirements can be found in the installation directory for each engine version under the ThirdPartyNotices file.

By entering into this Agreement and using Third Party Software, you are accepting the terms of those additional or alternative licenses. In the case of additional license terms, the additional license terms will take precedence over any inconsistencies with the terms of this License with regard to the Third Party Software licensed under those additional license terms. You agree that the owners of the Third Party Software are intended third party beneficiaries to this Agreement in relation to your uses of Third Party Software.

c. Feedback and Contributions

You grant Xsolla a right to freely use and disclose any feedback or suggestions that you provide to us regarding the Licensed Technology (the “Feedback”). You acknowledge that we may use any Feedback, including any ideas contained in Feedback, for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without acknowledgment or compensation to you, including to develop, copy, publish, modify, or improve the Licensed Technology in our sole discretion. You understand that we may treat Feedback as non-confidential.

You grant Xsolla a non-exclusive, fully-paid, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, make, use, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, modify and make derivative works based on, and otherwise exploit any Contributions for all current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. “Contributions” means any information or content, including software or code, that (a) you make available to Xsolla via submissions to forums, wiki, Xsolla’s GitLab server, or other source code repository under our control and that are based upon or incorporate the Licensed Technology or (b) that you provide to Xsolla and explicitly designate in writing as a Contribution.

You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback or Contribution that you provide to Xsolla to grant Xsolla and other affected parties the rights described above. This includes but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights. If any rights to be licensed under this Section 6(c) may not be licensed under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and agree not to assert any of those rights.

## **B. Xsolla Backend Free Hosting Services**

Xsolla hereby offers to the User a free hosting service (“Free Hosting Service”) as part of its Xsolla Backend suite, under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. This Free Hosting Service is designed to provide Users with a reliable and scalable cloud-based infrastructure for the hosting of their Products.

a. Service Description: The Free Hosting Service includes, but is not limited to, server hosting, bandwidth provision, and data storage necessary for the operation of the User's Product. The service aims to support the User's Product lifecycle from development to deployment and operation.

b.

d. Transition to Paid Services: Should the User's needs exceed the usage limits of the Free Hosting Service, or should the User seek enhanced service levels, including but not limited to increased data storage, bandwidth, or dedicated support, the User may opt to transition to the Company's paid hosting services. Details of such services and applicable fees will be made available by the Company.

e. Acceptable Use: The User agrees to use the Free Hosting Service in compliance with the Acceptable Use Policy outlined in this Agreement and not to engage in any activity that could harm the Company's infrastructure or other users' interests. Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to, hosting of illegal content, perpetration of security threats, and excessive resource consumption. The User agrees to utilize the Free Hosting Service in a manner that is respectful of the Company's infrastructure and considerate of other users. Specifically, the User commits to not engaging in activities that could compromise the integrity, security, or performance of the Company's services or adversely affect other users. These prohibited activities include, but are not limited to:

-   Hosting, distributing, or sharing content that is unlawful, including material that infringes upon intellectual property rights or promotes illegal activities.
-   Engaging in actions that pose security risks, such as spreading malware, conducting phishing attacks, or attempting unauthorized access to systems.
-   Consuming resources (such as bandwidth, storage, and processing power) in a manner that significantly exceeds normal usage patterns, potentially impairing service performance for other users.

The Company reserves the right to determine, at its sole discretion, what constitutes excessive resource consumption, security threats, or violations of this provision. Failure to comply with these terms may result in suspension or termination of the User's access to the Free Hosting Service.

## **C. Our Relationship**

### **1. The Agreement Between You and Xsolla**

a. Amendments

If we make changes to this Agreement, you are not required to accept the amended Agreement, and this Agreement will continue to govern your use of any Licensed Technology you already have access to. However, if we make changes to this Agreement, you will not be allowed to access certain Xsolla services or download the Licensed Technology unless you have accepted the amended Agreement. If we make changes, we will provide you with notice, such as by sending an email or giving you notice when you next log into an Xsolla service.

b. Alternative and Additional Terms

With respect to your rights and obligations related to Licensed Technology, this Agreement supersedes any prior Xsolla Backend End User License Agreement or Xsolla Backend End User License Agreement you may have. Those agreements will continue to survive only to the extent that you continue to have rights and obligations under them related to Content, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. Once you have also agreed to the Xsolla Content License Agreement, those agreements will be superseded completely. This Agreement, however, does not supersede, amend or otherwise affect other agreements you may have with us or any sublicensor authorized by us, other than as described in Section 7(a). For example, if we grant you a license to use Xsolla Backend to develop one or more products under a custom license, that custom license and not this Agreement governs your use of Xsolla Backend and related materials with respect to those products.

c. Notice

Where this Agreement calls for notice from us, including written notice, we may provide notice to you through the Xsolla services or by any email address that you’ve provided to us.

If you are an individual, you are the User.

If you are a legal entity, the individual employees or agents exercising your rights under this Agreement are Users. When exercising a legal entity’s rights under this Agreement, Users are not required to accept this Agreement as individuals. The User may store the Licensed Technology on any of the User’s computers, but the Licensed Technology cannot be shared with others except as part of a permitted Distribution of Licensed Technology as described in Sections 3 and 4.

d. Use by Educational Institutions

As an exception to the above requirement that only a User may use the Licensed Technology, if you are an educational institution, like a school or a library, you may store Licensed Technology on any of your computers, and you may allow all users of those computers to use the Licensed Technology under the License on those computers.

## **D. Other Rights and Obligations**

### **1. Disclaimers**

Nothing in this Agreement will prejudice any statutory rights that you have that may not be waived. Some countries, states, provinces or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability as stated in this and the next sections, so the below terms may not fully apply to you. In those jurisdictions, the exclusions and limitations below apply only to the extent permitted by the applicable laws of such jurisdictions.

THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING ALL INFORMATION, CONTENT, MATERIALS, CODE, AND SOFTWARE, ARE PROVIDED BY XSOLLA ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. XSOLA AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS THE “XSOLLA PARTIES” MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, REGARDING THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY. YOUR USE OF THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE XSOLLA PARTIES DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. THE XSOLLA PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE FOREGOING WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS WERE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN SETTING CONSIDERATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

### **2. Limitation of Liability**

TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE XSOLLA PARTIES, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHER, TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE XSOLLA PARTIES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF \$1,000 AND THE TOTAL AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID IF ANY TO XSOLLA UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE 12 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE EVENTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.

SEEKING DAMAGES AS LIMITED BY THIS SECTION 12 SHALL BE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF THE XSOLLA PARTIES.

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THESE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND EXCLUSIONS OF POTENTIAL DAMAGES WERE AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN SETTING CONSIDERATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

### **3. Indemnification**

This section only applies to the extent allowed by the applicable laws of your jurisdiction. If the applicable laws of your jurisdiction do not allow you to enter into the indemnification obligation below, then you assume, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws of your jurisdiction, all liabilities, damages, judgements, awards, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) that are the stated subject matter of the indemnification obligation below.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Xsolla Parties from and against all liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) arising out of or in connection with any third-party claims, demands, or actions (i) that, if true, would involve a breach by you of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any distribution or sublicensing of the Licensed Technology in violation of this Agreement), or (ii) related to your Products or your exercise of the License (except to the extent the third party is alleging your authorized use of unmodified Licensed Technology originally provided to you by Xsolla under this Agreement infringes any patent, trademark, or copyright).

### **4. Governing Law and Jurisdiction**

a. Governing Law. This Agreement and its interpretation, and any disputes that arise hereunder, shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, USA, without giving effect to any principles that may provide for the application of the law of another jurisdiction. Your national law may explicitly give you rights and obligations to resolve disputes in a manner different from the one indicated below. In this case, your national law applies.

b. Disputes. Most User concerns can be resolved by use of our Xsolla support site at [https://help.xsolla.com](https://help.xsolla.com/). If we are unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains between you and Xsolla, this section explains how we agree to resolve it.

This Agreement is between you and Xsolla (USA), Inc., a company registered in the USA, State of California with the company registration number C3140351 and with the office at 15260 Ventura Boulevard, Suite 2230, Sherman Oaks, California, 91403 USA, email: [support@xsolla.com](mailto:support@xsolla.com), telephone: +1(818)435-6613; the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts-of-law rules, govern this Agreement and your use of the Xsolla Backend Technology; and you expressly agree that for claims and disputes not subject to the arbitration agreement below, the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be determined by final and binding arbitration in Los Angeles, California, before a single arbitrator. You and Xsolla agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The arbitration shall be resolved by the arbitration of one arbitrator (“Arbitrator”) in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, Applicable Law and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org), and the provisions of this Agreement. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The place of arbitration shall be Los Angeles, California, USA. The cost of any arbitration shall be shared equally by the parties but the Arbitrator shall be authorized to enter, as part of the award to a party, an amount equal to reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs related to the arbitration, and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The Arbitrator may award equitable relief. The Arbitrator’s decision(s) shall be final and conclusively binding on the Parties, and judgment upon such award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The Arbitrator shall make a decision in writing and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. The Arbitrator must follow the Applicable Law, and any award may be challenged if the Arbitrator fails to do so. YOU AND XSOLLA AGREE THAT EACH ONLY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The Arbitrator shall not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims and shall not preside over any type of representative or class proceeding. The Arbitrator may only award declaratory or injunctive relief in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If this specific subsection is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.

c. Limitation of Time to File Claims. Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to this Agreement must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues; otherwise such cause of action or claim is permanently barred.

d. Arbitration Notice. A party that intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice to Xsolla of its intent to arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to Xsolla should be sent by any of the following means: (i) via electronic mail to [legal@xsolla.com](mailto:legal@xsolla.com); or (ii) by sending the Notice by certified mail to Xsolla (USA), Inc. according to the address referenced above. The Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (y) set forth the specific relief sought. If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, you or Xsolla may commence an arbitration proceeding.

### **5. No Class Actions**

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you and Xsolla agree to only bring disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement in an individual capacity and will not:

a. seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or classwide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions); or

b. consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit another to do so without the express consent of all parties to this Agreement.

## **E. Royalty Addendum**

If you Distribute a Product under Section 3(b) of the Agreement (a “Royalty Product”) or generate advances or other revenue for a Royalty Product prior to its Distribution, you must comply with the terms of this Royalty Addendum.

### **1. What Products Require Royalty Payments to Xsolla**

This addendum only applies to advances or other revenue generated in connection with Royalty Products. As a reminder, as further specified in Section 3(a) of the Agreement, this means the addendum generally does not apply to (and no royalty payments are due for):

a. Distributions of Non-Backend Products;

b. Distributions of Products that do not directly generate revenue;

c. Distributions of Products within your company group;

d. Distributions of Products to clients who hired you to develop the Products for them; and

e. Distributions of Products via Xsolla Backend Marketplace or Xsolla’s GitLab server to third parties who are separately licensed by us to use the Backend Code.

### **2. Prerequisites for Distributing a Product Requiring Royalty Payments**

Before you Distribute a Royalty Product that will generate revenue, you must give Xsolla notice of your intended Distribution (“Notice of Distribution”) as early as reasonably possible and in any event prior to the Distribution of the Royalty Product. Likewise, if you plan on beginning to generate revenue from a Royalty Product that you have already Distributed, you must submit a Notice of Distribution as early as reasonably possible before the Royalty Product is used to generate revenue. You must give Xsolla the notice required under this section by submitting the release form found at [xsolla.cloud/release](https://xsolla.cloud/release).

*Please note that failure to submit your Notice of Distribution of a Royalty Product on time will mean that you will not be entitled to deduct some Allowed Exclusions (see Section 4(b)) when calculating your Royalty Revenue.*

### **3. What is the Royalty Rate?**

You agree to pay Xsolla a royalty equal to 5% of all Royalty Revenue (as defined in the next section), regardless of whether that revenue is received by you or any other person or entity.

### **4. How the Royalty Payment Is Calculated**

Royalty payments are calculated by multiplying the royalty rate of 5% by the Royalty Revenue. “Royalty Revenue” means all worldwide gross revenue attributable to each Royalty Product minus any allowed exclusions.

a. Worldwide Gross Revenue

Worldwide gross revenue includes all revenue directly generated by your Royalty Product, regardless of who receives the revenue and regardless of whether you Distribute your Royalty Product to end users directly, self-publish via the App Store or any similar store, or work with a publisher or distributor.

Royalty Revenue includes gross revenue:

i. resulting from any and all sales of a Royalty Product to end users through any and all media, including but not limited to digital and retail;

ii. resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable content, microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or exchange of user-generated content for use with a Royalty Product, or redemption of virtual currency which directly affects the operation of the Royalty Product, whether redeemed within the Royalty Product or externally;

iii. from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is directly associated with Royalty Product access or in-Royalty Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered campaign, if an amount is established in an early tier solely for Royalty Product access, your royalty obligation will apply to that amount for each backer with the same access, but not on additional amounts in higher tiers based on ancillary benefits);

iv. from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;

v. from any advance payments for a Royalty Product (from a publisher or otherwise);

vi. received in connection with a Royalty Product’s inclusion in a streaming, subscription, or other game-delivery service (e.g., Apple Arcade, Microsoft GamePass, or any similar or successor services), including without limitation development funds and bonuses; and

vii. received in any other form actually attributable to a Royalty Product (unless excluded below).

b. Allowed Exclusions

However, some gross revenue is excluded from the calculation of Royalty Revenue.

Quarterly exclusion: You will not owe us any royalty payments for calendar quarters in which you do not reach a certain threshold.

The following is excluded from the calculation of Royalty Revenue:

i. revenue attributable to a Royalty Product from a calendar quarter during which the gross revenue for such Royalty Product is less than \$10,000.

The following simplified examples illustrate how quarterly exclusions work.

1.  Your Royalty Product generates \$9,000 in the first calendar quarter and \$9,000 in the second calendar quarter. You will not owe any royalties for either quarter.
2.  Your Royalty Product generates \$9,000 in the first calendar quarter and \$10,100 in the second calendar quarter. You will not owe any royalties for the first quarter and, unless another exclusion applies, you will owe \$505 (\$10,100 x .05 in royalties for the second quarter.

Royalty alternative exclusions: You may have already made a royalty payment or have other fee obligations to Xsolla on certain revenue generated by a Royalty Product.

To prevent you from being charged twice by Xsolla on such revenue, the following exclusions apply to the calculation of Royalty Revenue:

i. royalties that you pay on an advance payment of revenue for a Royalty Product that is recoupable by the payer, such as a publisher, may be credited against future royalty payments that you incur under this Agreement for that Royalty Product; and

ii. revenue generated from sales of your Product using Xsolla Pay Station, and from any subsequent in-Product purchases making use of Xsolla’s payment services.

*The following simplified examples illustrate how royalty alternative exclusions work.*

*● Your publisher pays you a \$1,000,000 advance on a Royalty Product you are developing that the publisher may recoup against future sales of your Royalty Product. You owe \$50,000 to Xsolla for that advance 5% of \$1,000,000.*

*● You charge \$20 for your Royalty Product and have sold 90,000 copies of it using Xsolla payment services. Under this Agreement, you would not owe any royalty payments on the \$1,800,000 you have earned.*

Other exclusions: The following are also excluded from the calculation of Royalty Revenue:

i. revenue from a Royalty Product which is Distributed (whether by you or any other third party) only to third parties who are separately licensed by us to use Xsolla Backend is excluded from Royalty Revenue;

ii. revenue from ancillary products that are not software and that do not contain embedded information (such as QR codes) that affects the operation of the Royalty Product (e.g., comic books, soundtracks, apparel);

iii. cash prizes given with awards earned for the Royalty Product;

iv. revenue from donations for a Product which are not tied to Royalty Product access or in-

Royalty Product benefits;

v. funding you receive from Xsolla through the Xsolla Funding Club program; and

vi. revenue from a Royalty Product that is used, displayed, and performed solely at a physical location under your control or the control of your authorized distributors and that is not otherwise Distributed to users, such as interactive amusement park rides, coin-op arcades, or location-based VR experiences, which use the Licensed Technology.

### **5. Additional Examples**

The following additional simplified examples illustrate how royalty payments are calculated. You charge \$10 for your Royalty Product on the App Store. When you distribute a copy, Apple may only pay you \$7 (having deducted 30% as a distribution fee). However, your Royalty Revenue would be \$10 and your royalty payment to Xsolla would be \$0.50 5% of \$10.

### **6. Reporting and Making Your Royalty Payments**

Within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which you earn Royalty Revenue, you must report the Royalty Revenue to Xsolla on a per Product basis and pay Xsolla 5% of the Royalty Revenue. Additional information on royalty reporting and payment can be found at [xsolla.cloud/release](https://xsolla.cloud/release).

Xsolla reserves the right to charge a 2% late fee, per calendar quarter (compounding), for any amounts unpaid after the required due date.

Except to the extent required by applicable law, all payments, fees and royalties are nonrefundable under all circumstances.

### **7. Other Obligations You Have**

a. Taxes

You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made by you under this Agreement (other than taxes that Xsolla is obligated to pay on its income, which are Xsolla’s responsibility). If you are required by a government agency to reduce your payment to Xsolla for any reason, you are required to provide sufficient documentation to Xsolla supporting the withholding. Xsolla cannot answer your questions about withholding taxes or taxes in general but provides general resources available at [xsolla.com/contact-us](https://xsolla.com/contact-us).

b. Records and Audits

You agree to keep accurate books and records related to your development, manufacture, Distribution, and sale of Royalty Products and related revenue. Xsolla may conduct reasonable audits of those books and records. Audits will be conducted during business hours on reasonable prior notice to you. Xsolla will bear the costs of audits unless the results show a shortfall in payments in excess of 5% during the period audited, in which case you will be responsible for the cost of the audit.
