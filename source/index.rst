**AcceleratXR** is a powerful technology platform for building highly-scalable online games and entertainment products.
Started in 2018 by veteran developers of the gaming industry with over fifty years combined experience, AcceleratXR
builds upon open source technology, such as `Composer.js <https://www.composerjs.io>`_ and
`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_, to create the industry's most customizeable and feature-rich online gaming
platform.

The team behind **AcceleratXR**, pronounced simply *accelerator* (`/əkˈseləˌrādər/`), built the platform with the
ambitious goal to dramatically **Accelerat**\e E\ **x**\tended **R**\eality product development. With this goal in mind
the team has defined three dimensions of success.

- Faster Time to Market
- Reduced Development Cost
- Lower Cost of Ownership

Time to Market
==============

Most other solutions in the industry tend to offer only a handful of capabilities, often targeting mobile games
with simplistic online and multi-player designs. As fellow game developers we know how much additional work
is required to ship bold and exciting new experiences audiences will love. This lack of overall capability is often
why many developers choose to build their own custom solution while smaller, indie, teams are left with litte to no
other choice.

Having experienced these problems first-hand the AcceleratXR team made it priority number one to provide a robust
collection of systems and features native to the platform itself. This focus on features first empowers teams to spend
more of their time building a better product instead of worrying about basic backend infrastructure and online systems
development.
